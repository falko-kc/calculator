# calculator
Implementation of Infix to Postfix transformation for basic calculator in Python.

The infix notation is not very convenient if an expression has operations with different priorities, especially when brackets are used. But we can use ***postfix notation***, also known as ***Reverse Polish notation (RPN)***. In this notation, operators follow their operands.
